***Handwritten Number Recognition***

*(Team up with [https://github.com/zivmax](https://github.com/zivmax/si100b-2022fa-proj))*

## Description of This Project

In this project, we will try to perform simple recognition of handwritten numbers.  

* Raspberry Pi will be our platform, on which we will complete operations such as color gamut conversion, segmentation, and denoising of digital images.  

* After that, we will complete the recognition of handwritten numbers based on the KNN algorithm.  

* In addition, we will build a digital tube display circuit to display the results, and a camera control circuit to control the shooting of the camera.
